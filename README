VobSub2SRT is a simple command line program to convert =.idx= / =.sub= subtitles
into =.srt= text subtitles by using OCR.  It is based on code from the
[[http://www.mplayerhq.hu][MPlayer project]] - a really really great movie player.  Some minor parts are
 copied from [[http://ffmpeg.org/][ffmpeg/avutil]] headers. [[http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/][Tesseract]] is used as OCR software.

vobsub2srt is released under the GPL3+ license. The MPlayer code included is
GPL2+ licensed.

The quality of the OCR depends on the text in the subtitles. Currently the code
does not use any preprocessing.  But I'm currently looking into adding filters
and scaling options to improve the OCR. You can correct mistakes in the =.srt=
files with a text editor or a special subtitle editor.

* Building
You need tesseract >= 4.1. You also need meson and gcc to build it.

You should also install the tesseract data for the languages you want to use!

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  meson build
  ninja -C build
  ninja -C build install
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Usage
vobsub2srt converts subtitles in VobSub (=.idx= / =.sub=) format into subtitles
in =.srt= format.  VobSub subtitles consist of two or three files called
=Filename.idx=, =Filename.sub= and optional =Filename.ifo=. To convert subtitles
simply call

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  vobsub2srt Filename
#+END_EXAMPLE

with =Filename= being the file name of the subtitle files *WITHOUT* the
extension (=.idx= / =.sub=). vobsub2srt writes the subtitles to a file called
=Filename.srt=.

If a subtitle file contains more than one language you can use the =--lang=
parameter to set the correct language (Use =--langlist= to find out about the
languages in the file).  For some languages you might need to set the tesseract
language yourself (e.g., chi_tra/chi_sim for traditional or simplified chinese
characters).  You can use =--tesseract-lang= to do this.  In most cases this
should however be autodetected.

If you want to dump the subtitles as images (e.g. to check for correct ocr) you
can use the =--dump-images= flag.

Use =--help= or read the manpage to get more information about the options of
vobsub2srt.

* Bug reports
Please submit bug reports or feature requests to the
[[https://github.com/ruediger/VobSub2SRT/issues][issue tracker on GitHub]].  If you do not have a GitHub account and feel
uncomfortable creating one then feel free to send an e-mail to
<ruediger@c-plusplus.de> instead.

If you have problems with a specific subtitle file then please check if
it works in mplayer first.  If it does not then please report the bug to
mplayer as well and link to the mplayer bug report.

For bug reports please run =vobsub2srt= with the =--verbose= option and copy
and paste the full output to the bug report.
